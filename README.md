# 🦟 Mosquito Speed Visualizer

> A fun and animated visualization of how a mosquito might react inside a fast-moving car. Watch it chill, panic, or even splat into the windshield based on your car's speed. Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP for smooth animations.

---

## 🧠 Concept

What happens to a mosquito trapped inside a car? Does it stay still? Does it fly backward? This interactive project simulates the mosquito's experience visually and lets you adjust the speed of the car to see how it reacts:

- 😌 Chill at low speed
- 😰 Sweating at medium
- 🥴 Dizzy at fast
- 💥 Smashed at ultra fast
